1) Process:

   For the users to get a better search experience, the search bar is clearly visible in the center with a "sortby"  
   filter below it and other filters to the left side of the page.

   The reason for doing this is the user need not stress to check for the "sortby" and other filters because they are 
   nicely grouped together.

   The search results are hard-coded to simulate search experience.

2) Technologies used:

   Used HTML 5 and Bootstrap for the page layout and css for rounded borders around the filters.

   Used JavaScript to validate the calendar.

3) The webpage is completely responsive.
